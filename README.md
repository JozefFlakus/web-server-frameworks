# Web-Server Frameworks Team

## Purpose

The Web-Server Frameworks Team is a place for Node.js framework authors and users to collaborate on the
future direction and feature set of the frameworks and related Node.js core APIs.  The main goal of the
team is to improve collaboration across the ecosystem and foster a better dialog between all parties involved.

### What are Web-Server Frameworks

A web-server framework is a tool/library/package which offers a higher level abstraction for how users interact
with over the wire protocols (ex. http1/2/3 or WebSockets).  In the Node.js ecosystem there are a few notable examples:

- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express/)
- [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)
- [Hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi)
- [Restify](https://github.com/restify/node-restify)

### Goals

Topics which this team discussed or challenges this team decides to take on should fall under one of the goals of the team:

- Improve Node.js core api support for frameworks
- Improve collaboration among framework authors
- Provide support for framework when security and bugs arise

Things which should not be done in this repo:

- Framework wars
- Promotion of specific tools/resource/etc. without a clear topic for collaboration/discussion
- Putting down projects, authors or solutions to a problem
